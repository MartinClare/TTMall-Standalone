Look for:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Videos Don't Persist After Refresh

**Problem**: Uploaded videos disappear after page refresh

**Solution**: Add persistent storage volume

1. Go to your service in Railway
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Volumes" section
4. Click "+ New Volume"
5. Settings:
   - **Mount Path**: `/app/public/uploads`
   - **Size**: 1 GB or more
6. Click "Add"
7. Railway will redeploy automatically
8. Test again after redeployment

### App Not Loading (502 Error)

**Possible causes:**
- App is still starting up (wait 30-60 seconds)
- Build failed - check deployment logs
- Port configuration issue

**Solution:**
1. Check logs in Deployments tab
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify latest deployment is "Active"
4. Try manual redeploy: Settings → Redeploy

### Videos Won't Play

**Possible causes:**
- Using sample videos with CORS restrictions
- Network issues
- Browser compatibility

**Solution:**
1. Try different browser
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Upload your own video files

### Out of Memory / Slow Performance

**Solution:**
1. Check metrics in Railway dashboard
2. May need to upgrade plan for more resources
3. Optimize video file sizes
